## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Disadvantages of Weeding Machines

1. High Initial Cost

Power weeders, rotary weeders, or mechanized inter-cultivators are expensive for small and marginal farmers.

Maintenance costs (spare parts, fuel, repairs) add up.

2. Fuel & Maintenance Dependence

Most power weeders need petrol/diesel → running cost is high.

Regular servicing required; breakdowns can halt work.

3. Limited Field Suitability

Cannot be used in very small or irregular-shaped plots.

Some machines are unsuitable for waterlogged fields (like paddy during monsoon).

4. Crop Damage Risk

Improper handling may damage crops, especially young seedlings.

Sharp blades may cut unintended plants.

5. Skill Requirement

Farmers need training to operate machines effectively.

Incorrect use can reduce efficiency or harm soil/crops.

6. Not Fully Effective on All Weeds

Some deep-rooted or creeping weeds may not be removed completely.

Manual intervention may still be needed.

7. Soil Disturbance

Rotary or power weeders may disturb soil too much → affects soil structure or exposes roots.

8. Accessibility Issues

Large or motorized machines may not be accessible in remote or uneven fields.

9. Noise & Pollution

Petrol/diesel engines produce noise and emissions → not eco-friendly.

Electric versions reduce this but are less common in rural areas.

10. Limited Automation (Traditional Machines)

Most traditional weeders require manual control → labor still needed.

Smart/AI-based automation exists but is costly and complex to implement
